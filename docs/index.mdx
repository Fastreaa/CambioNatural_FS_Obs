# How do we meet and collaborate  
## to lead towards a desirable future for all and the planet?

We explore how people, institutions and sectors can **meet, align and collaborate**
to respond to complex challenges that no single actor can solve alone.

## We are collaborative supporting bridge builders

Our work focuses on creating **spaces, frameworks and tools** that allow
diverse actors to collaborate meaningfully across sectors, disciplines and cultures.

We believe collaboration is not accidental —  
it is **designed, facilitated and sustained**.

## Cross-sector Collaboration Framework

### CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK

Developed a **Cross-sector Collaboration Management Framework and Toolkit**
for *TeamUp*, a cross-sectoral initiative supporting young people in rural Uganda.

This framework enabled:

- Youth leaders  
- Local government  
- Civil society  
- NGOs  
- Private companies  

to come together and engage in a **purposeful way**, guided by **shared values and principles**.

---

### SINGLE SECTOR INITIATIVE

In some contexts, collaboration begins within a **single sector**.
These initiatives serve as controlled environments where practices, values
and coordination mechanisms can be tested before scaling.

---

### CROSS-SECTOR COLLABORATION

When multiple sectors are involved, collaboration requires:

- Shared language  
- Clear governance  
- Trust-building processes  
- Continuous facilitation  

Without these elements, collaboration often collapses under its own complexity.
